# Saturn Ywidget
 
Steampunk Saturn Desktop Yahoo Widget, written in Javascript and XML for the Yahoo 
Widget (Konfabulator) Engine. Created for XP, Vista, Win7, 8, 10+ as well as the 
Apple Mac.

This widget is now deprecated and is retained for historical reasons only, it still works but time moves ever onward - please use the VB6 version instead that you will find here: https://github.com/yereverluvinunclebert/Saturn-VB6-Widget

This Saturn Desktop Widget is an attractive dieselpunk Yahoo widget for your 
desktop. This Konfabulator/ yahoo widget provides a simple static marble globe. 
Functional and gorgeous at the same time. This Widget is a moveable widget that 
you can move anywhere around the desktop as you require.

The others are the 'God of War', the planet Mars, Saturn and of course, the Earth. 
Double-clicking on the planet will cause a personalised Windows/Mac application 
to fire up. The first time you run it there will be no assigned function and so 
it will state as such - then it will pop up the preferences so that you can enter 
the command of your choice. The widget takes command line-style commands for
windows or Mac OS/X.

All javascript widgets need an engine to function, in this case the widget uses 
the Yahoo Widget Konfabulator engine. The engine interprets the javascript and 
creates the widget according to the XML description and using the images you 
provide. Designed and built by me.

Running the widget using a javascript engine frees javascript from running only 
within the captivity of a browser, you will now be able to run these widgets on 
your Windows desktop as long as you have the correct widget engine installed.
